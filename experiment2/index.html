				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>I wanted to make a autumnal river scene loosely based off my inspiration image. I really like bridges so I made sure my inspiration included a bridge.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>So the ground, sky, and bridge are all the same in every version and generally the bridge is in the center while the pathces of grass are on either 1/3 of the canvas.
					The trees are randomly placed, and are placed one by one on each side of the river, and they are drawn back to front using a variable that grows after each tree is placed.
					Their leaves are a simple circle with a random diameter and placed at the point of the triangle. 
					The river is a series of points placed using perlin noise that decides the rgb values of the point, with modifiers that scale based on which color value the noise is calculating.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>The experiement went ok, I do wish I had approach this project differently, especially because I used an inspiration image only towards the latter half the project
					and the start was only off the top of my head. Additionally I am turning this in late and wish I gave myself proper time to work on this and polish it more.
