				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>I am aiming to create a text generator that ad-libs in portions of a basic error message prompt.
					The idea was to make something that created somewhat reasonable error messages, as well as absolutely absurd ones that are incredibly aggressive, with some room inbetween.
					It was made in spirit of a number of memes regarding strange real-world or imaginary error prompts a computer might give.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>Just simply followed the example to create a generator with certain points that are filled in at random from one entry in a specific array of strings.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>No real challenges aside from my own time managament. Did have a bit of difficulty thinking of creative options, and also just accepted that the grammar for certain
					combinations would be awkward.
				</p>
